  # Workflow above calls each point above, which is a workflow in this repo (reuse)
  # Note: stage config shows that in stage (i.e. red background)
  # Note: Stage should have all contents (i.e. canary indicator)... which can get deleted in canary delployment
  
  # If smoke tests fail: notify PR team and Dev team and exit this workflow
  # PR team will delete that release in this repo
  # Could automate: 1) delete release... 2) trigger rollback workflow that builds and deploys usng last working commit SHA

  # Dev team notified via new issue with label
  # Rollback workflow updates this issue

  # Add data for metrics: "change failure rate" (this is a failure at stage... so log)
  # Add data for metrics: "mean time to recovery" from failure to rollback deployed in Stage

  # Dispatch to deploy to Canary
  # TODO: Setup repo for this and workflow (same as Stage)
  # Same smoke testing (aka PVT) and flow

  # Add data for metrics: "deployment frequency" (deployed to Canary as measure)
  # Add data for metrics: "lead time to change" (change in canary considered as change released to user)

  # End this workflow: From first push of feature change... to integration... to delivery via PR... to deployment to canary (aka Prod)
